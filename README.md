# Stress Relief Through VR

With a rise in violence in America over this past decade, I wanted to create a safe environment 
that would allow a person with built up stress or anger to release it in. 
It could also be a useful tool for anger management patients in therapy.  
People like to break things, because it is satisfying, and that satisfying feeling can be recreated in vr.
It can also be satisying for an average individual to break things and this environment allows a person
to fulfill that desire without the consequences: clean up, damage etc. 

About the game:

There are different tools to choose from to destroy the objects with. 
Gold square on the wall - touch to get a bomb spawned, it is grabbable
Middle blue square produces breakable crates
Right blue square produces breakable bottles.

Tools - baseball bat, axe
Bomb - explodes in 5 seconds, blinks as it gets closer to exploding - pushes all of the surrounding, moveable, 
        nearby objects away.
Rag doll - dressed as a bodyguard, grabbable
Destroyables - crate, bottle

The user goes to the wall and presses the buttons to produce the objects. The grab one of the tools on the blue platform 
and smash the bottles and crates. The broken pieces can be hit as well and grabbed. The faster you swing the further they fly.
The bomb is to be thrown at the boxes, bottles and ragdoll.

Why is VR a good medium to achieve your goals?

VR allows a person to experience a close enough version to the real thing to make it worth doing and it could be very 
spychologically similar without thenegative consequences of smashing objects or hitting people. 
VR could even go beyond the limits of real life, like the bomb game object. 


Critiques or limitations of VR for your goals? (optional)

The weight of the objects cannot be replicated yet which can make smashing an object feel unrealistic.
